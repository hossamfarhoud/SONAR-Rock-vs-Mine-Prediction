# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

🚀 Project Overview 
This project focuses on classifying objects as Rocks or Mines using machine learning models. The dataset contains sonar signals, and the aim is to build and evaluate models to predict whether a given object is a rock or a mine.

🔧 What You'll Learn

-How to preprocess and analyze sonar signal datasets.
-Techniques for splitting data and standardizing features.
-Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
-Visualization techniques for feature analysis and performance evaluation.
-Using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for evaluation.
-Identifying important features and tuning hyperparameter


📖 Dataset Details 
The Sonar Dataset contains 60 continuous features representing sonar signal properties. The target variable is:

R (Rock): 0
M (Mine): 1

🔗 Project Workflow 🚦 Step 1: Importing Libraries

Essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are used for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

🛠 Step 2: Data Exploration
-Explore the dataset structure and check for missing values.
-Analyze the target variable distribution to understand the balance between Rocks and Mines.

🔬 Step 3: Data Preprocessing 
-Standardize numerical features to improve model performance.
-Split the dataset into training (90%) and testing (10%) subsets.

⚙️ Step 4: Model Implementation 
-Train and evaluate multiple models, including:
-Logistic Regression
-Random Forest
-Gradient Boosting
-SVM
-Decision Trees
-Naive Bayes
-KNN

🧪 Step 5: Model Evaluation
-Visualize feature importance using Random Forest's feature importance scores..

🔍 Step 6: Feature Importance Analysis
-Visualize feature importance using Logistic Regression coefficients.

🧩 Step 7: Prediction on New Data 
Use the trained Random Forest model to predict whether new sonar data corresponds to a rock or a mine.

📊 Visualizations Included 
-Confusion Matrix to visualize model predictions.
-Feature Importance Barplot to highlight influential features.
-ROC Curve to evaluate model performance based on thresholds
